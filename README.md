# SRF-CarbonCapture
A model for assessing carbon capture through Short Rotation Forestry (SRF).

## Streamlit app

Run the interactive app locally:

```bash
pip install -e .
pip install streamlit matplotlib numpy
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

This launches an interface with sliders for all `srf_net_income` inputs and an enforced-100% tree species mix.
